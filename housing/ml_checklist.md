# Valuation of house prices using predictive techniques

1. The objective in business terms
	-  Investment in real estate generally seems to be profitable because their property values do not decline rapidly
2. Current solution
	- paper : http://www.iraj.in/journal/journal_file/journal_pdf/12-477-153396274234-40.pdf
3. Approach: Supervised Learning
4. Performance Measure
	-MAE, RMSE, MSE
	
# Get the Data
# Data exploration
# Data Preprocessing
1. finding out missing and redundant data
2. Delete NaN value
3. Try PCA
4. Try Factor Analysis
5. Try ICA
